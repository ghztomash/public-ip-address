# ðŸ”Ž Public IP Address Lookup and Geolocation Information

![Demo](./assets/map_example.png)

`public-ip-address` is a simple Rust library for performing public IP lookups from various services.

It provides a unified interface to fetch public IP address and geolocation information from multiple providers.

The library also includes caching functionality to improve performance for repeated lookups and minimaze rate-limiting.

## Usage

Add the following to your `Cargo.toml` file:
```toml
[dependencies]
public-ip-address = { version = "0.1" }
```
## Example

The simplest way to use this library is to call the `perform_lookup()` function, which returns a `Result` with a `LookupResponse`.
```rust
use std::error::Error;

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
    let result = public_ip_address::perform_lookup()?;
    println!("{}", result);
    Ok(())
}
```

More examplse can be found in the `examples` directory. And run them with the following command:
```bash
cargo run --example <example_name>
```
